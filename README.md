# GC CALCULATOR
2nd mini project of my python journey!

# features:
1. first short version takes in a string of dna and calculates its %GC content using wallace rule used in biology for primers(15-20 bps), [total gc content/length of seq. * 100].
2. further, as an extension to it i updated attributes like melting temperature and annealing temperature heavily used in PCR technique.
3. it takes in the dna string through a function, counts all the bases using for looping and conditional statements, applies the formula, returns all values and finally prints it.
4. FEEL FREE TO TEST A SEQUENCE OF INTEREST AND SUGGEST ANY CHANGES.

# points noted along the way:
1. how to start a counter and make it progressive so that it doesn't reset every time the block of code loops.
2. although didn"t apply in the code itself but learned that .upper() is used to capitalises small letter sequences in case user inputs that very sequence.
3. with the updated version, i learned how to return multiple variables and print them in more systematic and user friendly way.
